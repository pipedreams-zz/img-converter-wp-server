# Path Mapping Configuration
# Maps Windows network paths to local mount points
#
# Format: //server/share|/local/mount/point
#
# Example mappings:
# //fileserver/projects|/mnt/shares/projects
# //nas/media|/mnt/shares/media
# //backup-server/archives|/mnt/shares/archives
#
# The web UI will need to translate user-provided Windows paths to these mount points.
# For example, if the user enters:
#   \\fileserver\projects\client-abc\images
# The server will access:
#   /mnt/shares/projects/client-abc/images

# Add your network shares below (one per line):
# //your-server/share-name|/mnt/shares/share-name
