# Path Mapping Configuration
# Maps Windows network paths and drive letters to local mount points
#
# Two formats are supported:
#
# 1. UNC Path Mapping (2 fields):
#    Format: //server/share|/local/mount/point
#    Example: //fileserver/projects|/mnt/shares/projects
#
# 2. Drive Letter Mapping (3 fields):
#    Format: DRIVE:|//server/share|/local/mount/point
#    Example: T:|//fileserver/projects|/mnt/shares/projects
#
# Drive letter mappings allow users to enter paths like:
#   T:\00005 Büroportfolio\00_Projekte\02735 WKB - Kita Beuren
# Which will be translated to:
#   /mnt/shares/projects/00005 Büroportfolio/00_Projekte/02735 WKB - Kita Beuren
#
# You can define both formats for the same share if users access it both ways.

# Example configurations:
# T:|//fileserver/projects|/mnt/shares/projects
# P:|//nas/media|/mnt/shares/media
# //backup-server/archives|/mnt/shares/archives

# Add your network shares below (one per line):
